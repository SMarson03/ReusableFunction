/**
With that in mind, write functions that accomplish the following:
Take an array of numbers and return the sum.
Take an array of numbers and return the average.
Take an array of strings and return the longest string.
Take an array of strings, and a number and return an array 
of the strings that are longer than the given number. 
For example, stringsLongerThan(['say', 'hello', 'in', 'the', 'morning'], 
3); would return ["hello", "morning"].Take a number, n, and print every 
number between 1 and n without using loops. Use recursion.
